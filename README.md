## What is this?

WebObsidian is a web application that gives you an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-like
experience over a **real folder of Markdown files** living on your server. Your vault is
100% compatible with an existing Obsidian vault (including the `.obsidian/` folder) — you
can edit the same files from the Obsidian desktop app and from the web, side by side.

It is **single-user** and self-hosted: one master password protects the whole app, all
configuration lives in a plain `data/settings.json` (no database engine), and the entire
stack runs from a single `docker compose up`.

> **Why?** To access and edit your knowledge base from any browser, on any device, while
> keeping full ownership of your files — and to let AI agents read/write your vault through
> a safe, scoped REST API.

## 🔀 This fork

`phamtruonghung/webobsidian` = upstream [`xnohat/webobsidian`](https://github.com/xnohat/webobsidian)
`v0.1.1` **plus every open upstream pull request merged into `main`**, plus the tooling that deploys
and verifies it. Each PR keeps its own merge commit and author; the full table, the conflict
decisions and the bugs found while merging are in
[docs/UPSTREAM_PR_MERGES.md](docs/UPSTREAM_PR_MERGES.md).

**Where it runs:** LXC 107 (Proxmox homelab), Docker Compose, published at
`https://webobsidian.digitalciapp.com`. Merging to `main` deploys itself — CI → `Deploy (LXC 107)` on
a self-hosted runner *inside that LXC* → `deploy/deploy.sh`: git sync → rolling backup → keep the
previous image as `webobsidian:rollback` → build → `up -d` → wait for healthy → smoke test, with
automatic rollback if the build, the health check or the smoke test fails. Host layout, runbook and
rollback procedure: [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Which build is running?

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8787/healthz      # or the public URL
# {"ok":true,"version":"0.1.1","build":"71fbbc2"}
```

`build` is the git commit the image was built from (`dev` = image built outside `deploy/deploy.sh`).
Compare it with the branch tip, and check that the container runs the image you just built:

```bash
gh api repos/phamtruonghung/webobsidian/commits/main --jq '.sha[0:8]'
docker inspect <container> --format '{{.Image}}'
docker image inspect webobsidian:latest --format '{{.Id}}'   # the two must match
gh run list --repo phamtruonghung/webobsidian --workflow "Deploy (LXC 107)" --limit 3
```

### Upgrade notes — coming from upstream `v0.1.1`

- **The default password `123456` stops working as soon as any credential is configured** — a UI
  password, `WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD`, or `auth.passwordHash` in `settings.json`. It is refused both at
  login *and* as the "current password" in change-password, because that is exactly the state where
  the forced-change screen disappears. A fresh install is unchanged: `123456` works and must be
  changed.
- **`GET /auth/status` no longer returns `mustChangePassword`** — it was an unauthenticated oracle for
  "this instance still accepts the default". Clients read the flag from `/auth/login` and `/auth/me`.
- **The healthcheck probes `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`.** Inside the image `localhost` resolves to
  `::1` while the server binds IPv4 only and busybox `wget` does not fall back, so the old probe
  failed on every interval and the container reported `unhealthy` while serving every request. If you
  added a `docker-compose.override.yml` to work around that, delete it — the fix is in
  `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` (also offered upstream as
  [xnohat/webobsidian#30](https://github.com/xnohat/webobsidian/pull/30)).
- **Builds are identified.** `docker compose build --build-arg GIT_SHA=<sha>` bakes the commit into
  the image (`deploy/deploy.sh` passes it), and a deploy fails if the running container is not the
  image it just built.
- **New workspace `packages/webo`** — run `npm install` after pulling (or `docker compose up -d
  --build`). Root `npm test` now runs the server suite (vitest) *and* the web suite, and root
  `npm run typecheck` covers `packages/webo` too.
- **Symlinks inside the vault are followed** when their target is inside `ALLOWED_ROOTS` (realpath
  cycle guard); targets outside those roots are still refused.
- User-facing: reusable preview tabs, Catppuccin themes, graph touch/drag, English Account tab and
  comments, dark-mode text contrast, images whose name contains a space, and `DB_NAME_v2`-style table
  cells no longer rendering as italics.

### Never sync the vault to this repository

The app's **Settings → GitHub Sync** must not be pointed at this source repository: it pulls the
source tree (`CHANGELOG.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `server/`, `web/`, `.git`, …) into the vault,
where the app then serves those files as notes. Use a dedicated notes-only repo for vault
versioning — details and the recovery steps are in
[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#-vault-git-sync--never-point-it-at-this-repository).

### Keeping up with upstream

```bash
scripts/upstream-pr-status.sh              # every open upstream PR: merged here, or new?
scripts/upstream-pr-status.sh --new-only   # just the new ones (exit 1 when any exist)
scripts/merge-upstream-pr.sh <n>           # fetch refs/pull/<n>/head and merge with provenance
```

`.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` runs that check weekly and files an issue labelled
`upstream-sync` only when a genuinely new third-party PR exists.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Editor & rendering** — CodeMirror 6 with live / source / reading views; wikilinks
  `[[note]]`, embeds `![[file]]`, tags `#tag`, callouts, task lists, KaTeX math and
  Mermaid diagrams.
- 🕸️ **Graph view** — force-directed graph built from your wikilinks, with fly-to node
  search and highlighting.
- 🔗 **Backlinks & outline** — right sidebar tab strip: Backlinks (linked **and** unlinked
  mentions), Outgoing links (resolved/unresolved), Tags and Outline.
- 🔍 **QMD search** — fast full-text + fielded search (`tag:`, `path:`, `title:`), fuzzy +
  prefix matching, incremental indexing, persisted to disk for fast startup.
- 🔄 **GitHub sync** — native `git` pull / commit / push with **Git LFS** for large
  attachments, optional auto-sync, and per-file **version history** (browse & restore).
- 🔐 **Login gate** — a single master password (scrypt-hashed) protects everything; JWT in
  an httpOnly cookie.
- 🌐 **Public sharing** — turn any note into a read-only, server-rendered (SEO-friendly)
  public page at `/share/<token>`, optionally password-protected.
- 🤖 **Agent API** — scoped API keys (`read` / `write` / `search`) let AI agents work with
  the vault over REST at `/api/v1`. Every read returns a content `version`, writes can carry
  `base_version` (compare-and-set, no clobbering), `PATCH` edits in place with literal
  find/replace and `/note-matches` greps a note with line numbers. Bundled **MCP server** for
  MCP hosts. See [docs/AGENT_API.md](docs/AGENT_API.md).
- 🧩 **Community plugins** — install Obsidian plugins from GitHub; loaded against an
  Obsidian-API compatibility shim (subset support).
- 📱 **Responsive / mobile** — drawer sidebars, edge-swipe, an on-keyboard formatting
  toolbar, and touch-friendly targets, à la Obsidian Mobile.
- 🗃️ **Pure-JSON config** — everything lives in `data/settings.json`. No database.
- 🐳 **Docker** — one command to run the whole stack.

## 🚀 Quick start (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phamtruonghung/webobsidian.git   # the fork (see § This fork)
cd webobsidian
cp .env.example .env          # edit VAULT_HOST_PATH, set WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD
docker compose up -d --build
curl -s http://localhost:8787/healthz   # {"ok":true,"version":"0.1.1","build":"dev"} — "dev" = built here
# open http://localhost:8787
```

Out of the box it serves the bundled `./sample-vault`, so the stack boots immediately. All
deployment settings live in **`.env`** (git-ignored) — you never edit the tracked
`docker-compose.yml`, so a `git pull` / redeploy keeps your config and vault mapping intact.

No healthcheck override is needed in this fork: the probe targets `127.0.0.1` (upstream probed
`localhost`, which resolves to `::1` inside the image while the server binds IPv4 only, so the
container reported `unhealthy` forever). `build` in `/healthz` tells you which commit you are
running; `docker compose build --build-arg GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)` bakes it in.

## 🖥️ Desktop app (no server setup)

Prefer a native app? Grab an installer from the
[**upstream Releases**](https://github.com/xnohat/webobsidian/releases) page — available for
**macOS / Windows / Linux** (arm64 · x64 · ia32). This fork publishes no installers of its own yet;
build one from here with `npm run desktop:dist`:

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| macOS    | `.dmg` (or `.zip`) — arm64 / x64 |
| Windows  | NSIS installer `.exe` or portable `.exe` — x64 / arm64 / ia32 |
| Linux    | `.AppImage` or `.deb` — x64 / arm64 |

The desktop app bundles the whole server, picks your vault folder on first launch, and
**logs you in automatically** — no password to type, no Docker. Apps are currently
**unsigned**, so macOS Gatekeeper / Windows SmartScreen will warn on first open (right-click →
Open on macOS). Build it yourself with `npm run desktop:dist`; see
[`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md) for details.

## 🛠️ Process Manager CLI (`webo`)

Want to manage WebObsidian without Docker as a lightweight background daemon? Install the `webo` command line tool:

```bash
npm run build
npm run webo install    # symlinks 'webo' executable to PATH and scaffolds ~/.webobsidian/.env
```

Now you can control the WebObsidian background service directly from anywhere:

```bash
webo start             # Start WebObsidian as a background daemon
webo status            # Check process PID, port, and health check (/healthz)
webo logs -f           # Tail server logs (~/.webobsidian/webo.log)
webo restart           # Restart the daemon
webo stop              # Gracefully stop the server daemon
webo config            # Inspect active environment config (~/.webobsidian/.env)
webo uninstall         # Remove 'webo' symlink from PATH
```

---

### Point it at your own vault

```bash
# .env
VAULT_HOST_PATH=/abs/path/to/your/ObsidianVault   # must exist; bind-mounted to /vault
WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD=use-a-strong-password
HTTP_BIND=0.0.0.0                                  # 127.0.0.1 to expose only to localhost
HTTP_PORT=8787
```

Then `docker compose up -d --build`. Your vault can be a plain folder or a `git clone`
(Git LFS is supported for attachments).

### Behind a reverse proxy (TLS)

Set `HTTP_BIND=127.0.0.1` so the app is only reachable from the host, then terminate TLS
with nginx / Caddy / Traefik in front of `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

### Large vaults & file watching

A fresh VPS ships a low `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` (often 8192), which a big vault
exceeds. WebObsidian auto-detects this and falls back to **polling** (works anywhere,
higher CPU). For lower CPU, raise the kernel limit and keep native watching:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
echo 'fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

The search index (QMD) and link graph are kept in memory, so memory use scales with the
number of notes. The Docker image sets `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` (4 GB);
raise it to `8192` for very large vaults (e.g. 6k+ notes / multi-GB).

## 💻 Local development

Requires **Node ≥ 20** and `git` (+ `git-lfs` if you use LFS).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # server on :8787 + web dev server on :5173 (proxied)
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Production build (the server serves the built SPA):

```bash
npm run build
VAULT_PATH=./sample-vault npm start
# open http://localhost:8787
```

Useful scripts:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run dev` | Run server + web together in watch mode |
| `npm run build` | Build the web SPA, then compile the server |
| `npm start` | Run the production server (serves built web) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check server, web, `packages/webo` **and** `mcp-server` |
| `npm test` | Server suite (vitest) + web store suite (`node --test`) |
| `npm run webo -- --help` | The bundled process-manager CLI (see below) |
| `npm run mcp` | The bundled MCP server over stdio (needs `WEBOBSIDIAN_BASE_URL` + `WEBOBSIDIAN_API_KEY`) |
| `scripts/smoke-test.sh` | Boot the built server five times and assert the fork's behaviour (auth hardening, symlinked vault, SIGTERM teardown, Agent API read-modify-write, MCP handshake) — run `npm run build` first |

Canvas surfaces (the graph) must not read theme colours by hand: palette variables are aliases,
some are `hsl()`/`calc()` values a strict parser rejects, and the themed root is not always
`.theme-light/.theme-dark`. Use `resolveThemeColor` from `web/src/lib/cssColor.ts` and repaint when
the store's theme changes.

The server suite covers the vault write/trash/path-safety paths, git autosync and a real-git
integration run (a throwaway repo + bare remote, no network); the web suite covers the workspace
store, including preview-tab state. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, tests, the smoke
test and the Docker image build on every push and PR.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Docker env (`.env`, consumed by `docker-compose.yml`)

| Var | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `VAULT_HOST_PATH` | `./sample-vault` | Host path bind-mounted to `/vault` |
| `HTTP_BIND` | `0.0.0.0` | Host interface to publish on (`127.0.0.1` = local only) |
| `HTTP_PORT` | `8787` | Host port mapped to container `8787` |
| `WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD` | – | Seed/override the master password |
| `WEBOBSIDIAN_WATCH` | `auto` | `auto` (native + polling fallback) or `polling` |

### App-level env (read by the server; Docker sets these inside the container)

| Var | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8787` | HTTP port |
| `VAULT_PATH` | `./sample-vault` | Path to the notes vault |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Where `settings.json` + search index live |
| `ALLOWED_ROOTS` | – | Comma-separated roots the vault picker may browse |
| `WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD` | – | Seed/override the master password |
| `WEBOBSIDIAN_WATCH` | `auto` | File-watch mode: `auto` or `polling` |
| `NODE_OPTIONS` | `--max-old-space-size=4096` | Node heap size — raise for large vaults |

Everything else — git remote/token, API keys, plugins, theme — is configured in the
**Settings** UI and stored in `data/settings.json`.

## 🤖 Agent API

Scoped REST API for AI agents at `/api/v1`. Create an API key in **Settings → API Keys**,
then pass it as a header. Full reference: **[docs/AGENT_API.md](docs/AGENT_API.md)**.

**Safe read-modify-write.** A read returns the note's `version`; pass it back as `base_version` on
the next `PUT`/`PATCH` and a concurrent edit becomes a `409 version_conflict` (with the current
version to re-read) instead of a silent overwrite. Long notes can be read in line slices
(`?offset=&limit=`), and `PATCH {"find": …, "replace": …}` edits a literal string in place —
server-side, so a stale copy can never be written back. Set `WEBOBSIDIAN_AGENT_REQUIRE_VERSION=1`
to refuse unversioned writes outright.

### 🧩 MCP server (for MCP hosts)

`mcp-server/` is a stdio [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that wraps this API, so
Claude Code / Codex / any MCP host gets the vault as tools (`read_note`, `edit_note`, `grep_note`,
`search_notes`, …) with the conflict rules above built in:

```bash
npm run build && npm run mcp        # needs WEBOBSIDIAN_BASE_URL + WEBOBSIDIAN_API_KEY
```

See [`mcp-server/README.md`](mcp-server/README.md) for the host config snippet.

### 🧩 Drop-in agent skill (no clone needed)

Want your coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor…) to work with your vault
directly? **Copy the block below and paste it to your agent.** It downloads the skill from
GitHub, asks for your URL + API key once, saves them to `~/.webobsidian/credentials.json`,
and can then read/write/search your notes on request.

> First create an API key in the app at **Settings → API Keys** (scopes `read`/`write`/`search`).

```text
SYSTEM / TASK — Install the "webobsidian" agent skill from GitHub, then set up credentials.
Do every step in order; do not skip the credential step.

STEP 1 — Download the skill into your runtime's skills directory
  (Claude Code: ~/.claude/skills · Codex: ~/.codex/skills · OpenCode: ~/.opencode/skills):
      SKILLS_DIR=~/.claude/skills        # change for your runtime
      mkdir -p "$SKILLS_DIR/webobsidian"
      curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phamtruonghung/webobsidian/main/docs/agent-skill/webobsidian/SKILL.md \
        -o "$SKILLS_DIR/webobsidian/SKILL.md"

STEP 2 — Set up credentials (ASK ME; never echo the key back). Ask me for my WebObsidian
  base URL (e.g. https://notes.example.com) and my API key (looks like wok_...), then:
      mkdir -p ~/.webobsidian && chmod 700 ~/.webobsidian
      printf '{ "baseUrl": "%s", "apiKey": "%s" }\n' "<BASE_URL>" "<API_KEY>" > ~/.webobsidian/credentials.json
      chmod 600 ~/.webobsidian/credentials.json

STEP 3 — Verify (do NOT print the key) and confirm ready:
      BASE=$(python3 -c 'import json,os;print(json.load(open(os.path.expanduser("~/.webobsidian/credentials.json")))["baseUrl"].rstrip("/"))')
      KEY=$(python3 -c 'import json,os;print(json.load(open(os.path.expanduser("~/.webobsidian/credentials.json")))["apiKey"])')
      curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/health"
      curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "$BASE/api/v1/tags" | head
  From now on, when I ask you to work with my WebObsidian / Obsidian vault, use the webobsidian skill.
```

See [PRD.md §2](PRD.md) for the full design.

### Live Preview geometry — why vertical margins break click placement

CodeMirror positions the caret from a **height map** that it builds out of the border-box
rects of the blocks it renders, and it assumes those blocks stack directly on top of each
other. Space that a vertical `margin` contributes between two blocks never reaches that
map: the map ends up shorter than the document, and everything below the gap maps to a
document line that is one or two rows further down — you click a row and the caret lands
on the next one. (Measured: a note title + properties block + table pushed every click two
rows low; `contentDOM.scrollHeight` was 76px longer than the map.)

So, inside the editor, **vertical spacing on an editor block is `padding`, never `margin`**:

- Block widgets (`.cm-inline-title`, `.cm-properties`, `.cm-table-wrap`, `.cm-html-preview`,
  `.cm-html-block`, `.cm-mermaid`) carry their spacing as padding. Where a decorative box
  needs its own border (`.properties`), the widget renders a wrapper that owns the spacing —
  see `FrontmatterWidget.toDOM`.
- `.cm-table-wrap` is `display: block; width: fit-content` rather than `inline-block`: an
  inline-block sits on the text baseline, and the anonymous line box around it added ~7px
  the map could not see.
- Margins *inside* a padded block are fine (a child's margin stays within the parent's box).

Two guards keep it that way: `web/tests/editorSpacing.test.ts` fails CI if a vertical margin
reappears on an editor block, and (dev builds only) `livePreviewGeometryGuard` logs a console
warning when the height map is shorter than the rendered content. Attachments that load after
layout are handled by `mediaLoadRemeasure`, which re-measures on `load`/`error`.

### CodeMirror's own colours must be re-themed

This app themes through CSS variables on a `.theme-*` wrapper and never enables CodeMirror's
`darkTheme` facet, so anything CodeMirror hard-codes for light mode stays light on every theme.
Two of those are user-visible and are overridden in `obsidian.css`:

- **The caret.** `drawSelection()` hides the native caret (`caret-color: transparent !important`)
  and paints `.cm-cursor`, whose border is hard-coded `black` (`&dark` would be `#ddd`) — on a dark
  theme the caret was black on near-black. `.cm-editor .cm-cursor, .cm-editor .cm-dropCursor`
  take `var(--text-normal)`.
- **The Find & Replace panel** (`.cm-panels`, `Ctrl+F`): hard-coded `#f5f5f5` with browser-default
  white inputs; now themed with palette variables.

Rule of thumb: when a CodeMirror default looks wrong on a theme, override it with a palette
variable — never with a literal colour. `web/tests/editorTheme.test.ts` enforces this for the
caret and the panel.

## 🔒 Security notes

- Master password is scrypt-hashed; the JWT secret is auto-generated.
- **The well-known default `123456` is refused as soon as any credential is configured** (UI
  password, `WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD`, or a hand-edited `auth.passwordHash`) — it was previously accepted
  *alongside* the real password, so an instance that set an env password and never opened the UI was
  still reachable with the default. A fresh install still starts on `123456` and must change it.
- `GET /auth/status` deliberately reports nothing about whether the default is still in use (that flag
  was an unauthenticated oracle); `mustChangePassword` comes from `/auth/login` and `/auth/me`.
- API keys are hashed at rest and scoped (`read` / `write` / `search`) with per-key rate
  limiting and audit logging.
- All file paths are guarded against traversal; the vault picker is confined to
  `ALLOWED_ROOTS`.
- Secrets (git token / API keys) live in `data/settings.json` on the server — mount `/data`
  as a private volume and keep it off version control. **Change the default password.**

## 🗺️ Compatibility & scope

- ✅ Works directly on an existing Obsidian vault, including `.obsidian/` config.
- ⚠️ **Single-user (v1)** — no real-time multi-user collaborative editing yet.
- ⚠️ Git sync replaces Obsidian Sync/Publish.
- ⚠️ Community-plugin support is a **subset** of the Obsidian API; plugins relying on
  Electron/Node internals may not work.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! A few house rules from [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md):

1. **Follow [PRD.md](PRD.md).** It is the source of truth for design. Changing scope means
   updating the PRD first (with a changelog bump), then the code.
2. **Keep [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) in sync** — flip checkboxes and
   add a progress-log line as you work.
3. TypeScript everywhere; avoid `any`. Runtime config is JSON only (no DB engine).
4. Never log secrets/tokens; hash before storing; guard against path traversal.

Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` before opening a PR.

Agent-facing conventions for this repo live in [docs/agents/](docs/agents/): where work is tracked
(`issue-tracker.md`), the triage label vocabulary (`triage-labels.md`) and the domain-doc rules
(`domain.md`).

**Merging to `main` deploys itself** — CI must be green, then `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs
`deploy/deploy.sh` on the self-hosted runner inside LXC 107 (see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)).
That is intentional, so prefer a branch + PR over pushing straight to `main`, and keep the smoke test
(`scripts/smoke-test.sh`, run by CI) passing — a broken `main` would be deployed.
