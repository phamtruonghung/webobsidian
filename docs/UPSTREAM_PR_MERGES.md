# Merged upstream PRs (fork integration)

This fork (`phamtruonghung/webobsidian`) exists so that **all 17 open pull requests against
`xnohat/webobsidian` are live in one build**, regardless of whether upstream merges, closes, or
deletes anything. Nothing here depends on the upstream repository staying available: the merge
commits below contain every change in-tree, and the `upstream-pr-*` tags pin the exact head commit
of each PR.

- Integration branch: `integration/upstream-open-prs`, merged into `main`.
- Base: upstream `main` @ `c41967a` (`chore(release): v0.1.1`).
- Upstream refs fetched as `upstream/pr/<n>` from `https://github.com/xnohat/webobsidian` `refs/pull/<n>/head`.

Merge order was deliberately lowest-risk first (single-file fixes → the stacked test PRs #2/#6/#7
→ auth → UI/themes → vault → CLI/themes → lockfile last), so each step could be verified on its own.

## Decisions taken while merging

**#4 vs #15 — the same auth bug, two designs.** Both were kept as one union rather than picking a
winner: `checkPassword()` accepts the well-known default only when
`allowDefault && isDefaultPasswordActive(auth)` — #4's opt-in gate at the login route plus #15's
single shared policy (`userPasswordHash`/`passwordHash`/`WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD` all unset). #15's
`hasCustomPassword()`/`redactSettings()` now derive from that same predicate, so "the default is a
valid credential" and "the UI must force a change" can never disagree. One consequence is
deliberate and documented in `server/src/services/auth.test.ts`: under an override, `123456` is
refused as a login *and* as a "current password" too, because `mustChangePassword` is now false in
exactly that state (the ForceChangePassword screen only appears while `123456` actually works).

**Docs conflicts (`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PRD.md`).** Both files are append-only logs where each
PR adds its own entry; the merge keeps every entry (newest first) and collapses the duplicated
`Cập nhật lần cuối:` / `Phiên bản:` header lines into one, per each file's own convention.

**Root `test` script.** #29 added a root `test` that ran only its own web test file, which would have
hidden the server suite from #6/#7. Root `npm test` runs both: `vitest` (server) + `node --test` (web).

**Root `typecheck`.** #27 added the `packages/webo` workspace but did not add it to the root
`typecheck` script — which is how that package shipped with two `tsc` errors. It is included now.

**Bugs found in the merged PRs themselves (fixed here):**
- `server/src/index.ts` — #27 annotated `startWatcher(): chokidar.FSWatcher` without returning the
  watcher: `TS2355` on build, and `watcher.close()` in its own SIGTERM handler would throw on
  `undefined`. Added `return watcher;`. Note the watcher's polling-fallback path still swaps in a
  second watcher internally; the handle returned to the shutdown handler is the original one.
- `packages/webo/src/bin.ts` — the `spawnEnv` object spread inferred `{ NODE_ENV: string }`, so
  `spawnEnv.PORT`/`HOST` were `TS2339`. Typed as `NodeJS.ProcessEnv`.
- `server/src/services/vault.test.ts` — #23's `getAllowedRoots()` reads `vault.allowedRoots`, which
  the #6 fixture did not provide (19 tests threw). Fixture fixed and #23's feature gained the tests
  it shipped without (symlinked folder listed, file read through a link, write landing in the
  target, link outside every allowed root still refused, cycle guard, broken link skipped).
- `package-lock.json` — #24's promise of "0 production advisories" no longer held (advisories
  published after it: xmldom, multer, js-yaml, qs/express). `npm audit fix --omit=dev` re-run:
  0 production advisories, no manifest changes.

## Verified state of this fork

Every step was checked with the project's own gates (`npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`,
`npm test`), and the install is reproducible from the committed lockfile:

```
npm ci                 # lockfile is consistent with all 5 workspaces
npm run typecheck      # server + web + packages/webo
npm test               # 72 server assertions (vitest) + 11 web assertions (node --test)
npm run build          # web bundle + server tsc + webo CLI
npm audit --omit=dev   # 0 vulnerabilities
scripts/smoke-test.sh  # 9 runtime assertions against the built server
```

`scripts/smoke-test.sh` boots the built server three times (fresh install / `WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD`
override / symlinked vault) and asserts over HTTP what unit tests can't reach: `GET /auth/status`
carries no `mustChangePassword`, `123456` logs in only on a fresh install and is refused with an
override (while the override itself works and does not force a change), a symlinked folder is listed
and read through the API, and each boot logs the full 5-line teardown on `SIGTERM`. CI runs
`npm test` and the smoke test on every push and PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Syncing a future upstream PR

```bash
scripts/upstream-pr-status.sh              # every open upstream PR: merged here or new?
scripts/upstream-pr-status.sh --new-only   # just the new ones (exit 1 when any exist)
scripts/merge-upstream-pr.sh <n>           # fetch refs/pull/<n>/head from upstream and merge it
```

`merge-upstream-pr.sh` fetches `refs/pull/<n>/head` from upstream and merges it with the standard
provenance message. Use it the same way for later PRs — and if you re-merge something that is already
in `main`, git simply reports "Already up to date".

"Already merged" is decided by **ancestry** (`git merge-base --is-ancestor refs/remotes/upstream/pr/<n>
main`), so it stays correct whether the PR was merged here, merged upstream, or arrived through a
stacked branch.

The check runs by itself too: `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` scans every Monday (plus manual
dispatch) and, **only when a genuinely new PR exists**, opens or updates one issue labelled
`upstream-sync` listing it with the sync command. Silence means everything open upstream is already in
this fork.
