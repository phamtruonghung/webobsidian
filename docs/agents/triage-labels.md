# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker (`phamtruonghung/webobsidian`).

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

The label strings match the roles one-to-one, so `/triage` creates them as-is on first use and never
duplicates a role under a second name.

## Repo-specific labels used alongside them

- `deploy` — touches the LXC 107 deployment or the deploy workflow.
- `upstream-sync` — syncing later PRs from `xnohat/webobsidian` (see `docs/UPSTREAM_PR_MERGES.md`).

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
